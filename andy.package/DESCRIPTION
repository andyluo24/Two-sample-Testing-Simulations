Description: This package includes the specific implementations of the Nearest 
            Neighbor Test, the Energy Distance Test, the two-sample Hotellingâ€™s 
            T-square test, graph-based two sample test, and permutation test. 
            These tests are used to test for equal distributions. The first four
            tests can be used in multivariate distributions, while the last test 
            can only be used for univariate distributions.
